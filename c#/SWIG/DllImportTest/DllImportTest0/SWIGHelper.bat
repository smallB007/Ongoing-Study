:: Windows will not automatically append a .dll extension to library names that already have a period (.) 
:: in their name, such as libgtk-win32-2.0-0.dll. If you try to use libgtk-win32-2.0-0 as the library name, 
:: Windows won’t automatically append .dll, resulting in a DllNotFoundException. Consequently you should 
:: either avoid periods in library names or always use the full filename (including the .dll extension) and
:: rely on Mono’s <dllmap/> mechanism.
